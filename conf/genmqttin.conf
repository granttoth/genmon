# NOTE: single entries for topics, labels, types, units, nominal_values and 
# maximum_value do not require comma separators

# Required. a list of comma separated MQTT topics to subscribe. This add on will 
# monitor each topic and import the data into genmon for display. The maximum 
# number of topics to monitor is four
topics = 

# Required. A list of labels that corresponded to the list of topics. These labels
# will be used to display the data read from the MQTT broker in the User Interface 
# of genmon. Each label must be unique and the number of labels must match 
# the number of topics.
labels = 

# Required. A list of comma separated units. These correspond with the list of 
# topics. If a unit is not used then a blank will be used to keep alignment 
# with the number of topics. Then number of units (including blank units) must
# match the number of topics.
units = 

# Required. A list of comma separated types. These correspond with the list of 
# topics. Then number of types must match the number of topics. Valid types are:
#
#   fuel - Used for monitoring fuel gauges. The data is a percentage 0 - 100 of 
#       the fuel tank level. Max should be set to 100. Since this is a 
#       percentage units can be none or %.
#   temperature - Used for temperature sensors. Nominal and Maximum values are 
#       sensor specific
#   power - Used for importing power readings into genmon. This  should be used 
#       for reporting the total power (sum of all legs) of the system. Units 
#       should be W or kW.
#   current - Used for importing current readings into genmon. This should be 
#       used for reporting the total current (sum of all legs) of the system. 
#       Units should be A.
#   voltage - Used for reporting voltage. This is the total voltage for the 
#       system.
#   voltageleg1 - Used for reporting a single voltage leg. This value will be 
#       added to voltageleg2 for the total voltage. Units should be V.
#   voltageleg2 - Used for reporting a single voltage leg. This value will be 
#       added to voltageleg1 for the total voltage. Units should be V.
#   pressure - This is for reporting a sensor pressure. 
#   ct1 - This is used for report the current for the first leg in a multi-leg 
#       system. Units should be A.
#   ct2 - This is used for report the current for the second leg in a multi-leg 
#       system. Units should be A.
#   ctpower1 - This is used for report the power for the first leg in a multi-leg 
#       system. Units should be W or kW.
#   ctpower2 - This is used for report the power for the first leg in a multi-leg 
#       system. Units should be W or kW.

# gauge colors. This is a list of comma separated units. These correspond with

# If this value is not present then 1883 the default.

# Optional. This value will be added to the beginning of the MQTT path. The
# default path used is 'generator/' however you could add set root_topic=Home
# to make the path be Home/generator.

# Optional. Full path to Certificate Authority file. Leave empty to not
# use SSL/TLS. If used the port will be forced to 8883.

# Must be 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. This is ignored when a CA cert file is not used.

# Optional. Defines the certificate requirements that the client imposes
# on the broker. Used if Certificate Authority file is used. None,Optional,
